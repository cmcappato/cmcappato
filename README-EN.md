# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Carolina Cappato

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a developer passionate about data and technology, with experience in .NET, SQL and Python, currently working on my professional growth as a Data Analyst. I have more than 3 years of experience optimizing queries and managing high volumes of data, ensuring their integrity and protection, and looking for the best way to solve problems, adding value to the teams I collaborate with.

Currently, I am in the process to finish my Data Science and AI Technician, which allows me to combine my technical skills with an analytical approach to develop efficient and scalable solutions. Additionally, I am expanding my knowledge with Excel and Data Analytics courses on LinkedIn Learning.

I am actively searching for new job opportunities, and always willing to face challenges that allow me to keep growing and providing my experience in the world of data.
